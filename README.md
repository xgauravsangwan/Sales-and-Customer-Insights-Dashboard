## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard that analyzes the medicine sales data for the entire year of 2023 and 2025.

This initiative has been undertaken in response to stakeholders' requests to gain a clear understanding of sales performance. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the dashboard aims to assist stakeholders in making informed strategic decisions for future planning.

## Dataset Overview
This project involves analyzing medicine sales data using **three provided CSV files**. Each file represents a different aspect of the dataset: **customers**, **drugs**, and **sales transactions**. 

### Summary
 * **Customer Table**: Provides demographic and additional information about each customer.
 * **Drugs Lookup Table**: Contains details about each drug, including pricing and regulatory information.
 * ***Sales Transactions Table**: Records details of each sale, including the drug sold, the customer, and the transaction specifics.

## Dashboard Overview
Based on the project objective, I have developed a two-page Power BI dashboard report to analyze and visualize the medicine sales data for 2023. The dashboard is structured as follows:

### 1. Home Page
The Home Page provides an overview of the overall insights, including key performance indicators, sales trends, and a summary of the sales data. This page is designed to give stakeholders a quick and comprehensive view of the sales performance, highlighting essential metrics and overall business health.

### 2. Insights Page
The Insights Page is dedicated to demographic-based insights. It includes detailed visualizations and analyses of customer demographics, such as age, gender, and customer type (e.g., Frequent Buyer, New Customer). This page helps stakeholders understand the characteristics of their customer base and how different segments contribute to overall sales.
