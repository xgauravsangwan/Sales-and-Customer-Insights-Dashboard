## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard that analyzes the medicine sales data for the entire year of 2023 and 2025.

This initiative has been undertaken in response to stakeholders' requests to gain a clear understanding of sales performance. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the dashboard aims to assist stakeholders in making informed strategic decisions for future planning.

## Dataset Overview
This project involves analyzing medicine sales data using **three provided CSV files**. Each file represents a different aspect of the dataset: **customers**, **drugs**, and **sales transactions**. 

### Summary
 * **Customer Table**: Provides demographic and additional information about each customer.
 * **Drugs Lookup Table**: Contains details about each drug, including pricing and regulatory information.
 * **Sales Transactions Table**: Records details of each sale, including the drug sold, the customer, and the transaction specifics.

## Dashboard Overview
Based on the project objective, I have developed a two-page Power BI dashboard report to analyze and visualize the medicine sales data for 2023. The dashboard is structured as follows:

### 1. Home Page
The Home Page provides an overview of the overall insights, including key performance indicators, sales trends, and a summary of the sales data. This page is designed to give stakeholders a quick and comprehensive view of the sales performance, highlighting essential metrics and overall business health.

### 2. Insights Page
The Insights Page is dedicated to demographic-based insights. It includes detailed visualizations and analyses of customer demographics, such as age, gender, and customer type (e.g., Frequent Buyer, New Customer). This page helps stakeholders understand the characteristics of their customer base and how different segments contribute to overall sales.

## Real-World Recommendations Based on Insights
Based on the detailed insights from the Power BI dashboard analyzing the medicine sales data for 2023, here are the top five recommendations for stakeholders to consider:

 * **Focus marketing efforts on Lisinopril:**  The data shows Lisinopril is the top revenue generator.  Allocate marketing budget to promote this drug and potentially explore upselling or cross-selling related medications.

 * **Target high-value customers like David Johnson:**  Identify and target high-revenue customers like David Johnson with personalized marketing campaigns and loyalty programs to retain their business and potentially increase their purchases.

 * **Increase sales to female and younger demographics:**  The data suggests lower sales from females and younger age groups. Develop targeted marketing campaigns to reach these demographics and understand their specific needs and preferences.

 * **Expand sales in high-revenue countries**:  Canada leads in sales, followed by Australia, Germany, and the UK. Consider regional marketing campaigns or explore partnerships with distributors in these countries to further increase sales.

 * **Analyze seasonal trends and optimize promotions:**  Sales data indicates a peak in July and a dip in August.  Investigate reasons behind these trends and plan targeted promotions or discounts strategically to address seasonal fluctuations.

## My Learnings:
This project has significantly enhanced my analytical skills, particularly in using Power BI for data visualization and analysis. I am now more confident in my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights that can drive strategic business decisions. This experience has prepared me well for future data analysis projects, and I look forward to applying these skills in more complex and challenging scenarios.
